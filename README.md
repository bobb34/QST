# QST
Quiz/Survey/Test   --    Sept. 5, 2025

QST is a free, complete, secure, enterprise grade, open source online/lan assessment/exam solution.
You can try it at https://qstonline.org and download it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/qstonline/. 

We no longer maintain a release here due to the AI issue.

To us, open source means providing you our best software, not an inferior version. As we always have.

We have 0 security vulnerabilities in our software. Check that against other offerings, including Learning Management System's with quiz/test abilities.
  There is no reliance on "community" to secure our software, we do that ourselves before we release the code.
  
When a user takes a QST, you can be certain their mark was not tampered with.
  

  - Our single point access, with all input verified, sized and sanitized guarantees your security.

  - User lock out after 5 unsuccessful logins for 4 minutes (can be adjusted) foils brute force attacks.

  - Only single logins for each user allowed.

  - Role based authorization.

Don't believe the uncorroborated marketing statements vendors place on their sites claiming thousands to millions of users/downloads, etc., nor how they may be built on 'open standards'. How your software is implemented has no bearing on a standard format it may output, nor how well it performs, nor it's security vulnerabilities.

We are NOT SELLING software.

Our mission:
- To be 'the default assessment solution for general use' by providing this free, open source, continually evolving software for everyone.

We possess many, many decades of full stack software development experience which translates to a product that will save you money by being very economical to run at small or large scale, is extremely stable, secure and has a feature set that no others can match. 

At QST our teams mandate is to support this software and create new features (many are from users requests).
We provide free email support for installs and scaling.
We've been doing this since we first posted QST in 2018 and will continue to do so for many, many years to come.
At sourceforge.net you can see our track record and the work we put into our software.
We have just surpassed 21,000 downloads at sourceforge.net .

We do not update this site very regularly. Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/qstonline/ for updates and new versions.

Our latest release is QST version 3.12.09 on April 26, 2025.

We are currently completing our Copy/Paste interface for adding questions to QST generated by AI with our Import AI feature.
It will work with other templates on offer from other vendors and some basic formats already in use.

- We are proud of our contribution to open source assessment/examination and our ability to let you "own your questions" withtout being locked into one vendors format.

- AI is going to offer a huge abilty to create questions and QST fills the void for securely and economically using them to assess achievemnent levels.

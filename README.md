# QST
Quiz/Survey/Test   --    Mar 26, 2023

QST is a free, complete, secure, heavy duty, open source assessment solution.
You can try it at qstonline.org and download it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/qstonline/. 

Open source assessment software has been getting a bad name from commercial vendors enticing you to their sites with their claims of "open source software" only to find a crippled version of their commercial product and little/no support.
Others talk about the benefits of new features developed by the open source community being available to you, but it's been years since anyone developed new features! 
Many require you to run oudated software (example PHP 7.x and earlier) which can lead to security issues, because they do not want to spend the money to upgrade their non-paying software.

Don't believe the uncollaborated marketing statements vendors place on their sites claiming thousands to millions of users/downloads, etc., nor how they may be built on 'open standards'. How your software is implemented has no bearing on a standard format it may output.

We are NOT SELLING software.

Our mission:
To be 'the default assessment solution for general use' by providing this free, continually evolving software for everyone.

We possess many, many decades of software development experience which translates to a product that will save you money by being very economical to run at small or large scale, is extremely stable and has a feature set that no others can match. 

At QST our teams mandate is to support this software and create new features (many are from users requests).
We provide free email support for installs and scaling.
We've been doing this since we first posted QST in 2018 and will continue to do so for many, many years to come.
At sourceforge.net you can see our track record and the work we put into our software.


We do not update this site very regularly. Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/qstonline/ for updates and new versions.
Our latest release is QST version 3.09.06 on Mar 17, 2023.
